- remove all cars (DONE)
- implement forward and backwards only 

reward system
    - penalize each time step 
    - give a reward when you hit a checkpoint (but only once)

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
checkpoints -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Then can keep an array of booleans, if you land on a zone with false, add reward 
and set to true 

a  b

idx = (x // bucket length) - 1.
ex: if in first bucket, then no idx. But if second bucket, that means we have first checkpoint. (idx 0)
